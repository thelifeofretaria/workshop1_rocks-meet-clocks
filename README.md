# Workshop on phylogenetics and molecular clock calibration

In this repository you will find the materials that we will introduce on July 16.  
We would like to make more accessible molecular approaches, break myths, introduce basic concepts and showcase practical examples, hoping to bridge the micropaleontological and the Life of Retaria communities. We will briefly show where to find molecular data, how to run phylogenies, how to interpret phylogenies and how to calibrate the molecular clock, so that interested audience can begin to explore the fascinating world of DNA comparative approaches.  
Raphael Morard, Mattia Greco and Miguel M. Sandin, will be sharing their experience, with the help of micropaleontological experts Adam Woodhouse and Johan Renaudi.
