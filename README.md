# Workshop on phylogenetics and molecular clock calibration

In this repository you will find the materials that we introduced on July 16. Please have a look at the recording [here](https://youtu.be/m3sUC9PXV_w).  
  
We would like to make more accessible molecular approaches, break myths, introduce basic concepts and showcase practical examples, hoping to bridge the micropaleontological and the Life of Retaria communities. We briefly showed where to find molecular data, how to run phylogenies, how to interpret phylogenies and how to calibrate the molecular clock, so that interested audience can begin to explore the fascinating world of DNA comparative approaches.  
  
Raphael Morard, Mattia Greco and Miguel M. Sandin, shared their experience, with the help of micropaleontological experts Adam Woodhouse and Johan Renaudi.
